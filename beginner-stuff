#Police patrol a specific stretch of dangerous highway and are very particular about speed limits.  
#The speed limit is 65 miles per hour. Cars going 80 miles per hour or more are given a “Reckless Driving” ticket. 
#Cars going more than 65 miles per hour are given a “Speeding” ticket. 
#Any cars going less than that are labeled “Safe” in the system.  

#Fill in the blanks in this function so it returns the proper ticket type or label.
