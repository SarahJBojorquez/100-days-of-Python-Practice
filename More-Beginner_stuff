#Fill in the blanks to complete the while loop so that it returns the sum of all the divisors of a number, 
#without including the number itself. As a reminder, a divisor is a number that divides into another without a remainder. 
#To do this, you will need to:

#Initialize the "divisor" and "total" variables with starting values
#Complete the while loop condition
#Increment the "divisor" variable inside the while loop
#Complete the return statement

# Fill in the blanks so that the while loop continues to run while the
# "divisor" variable is less than the "number" parameter.

def sum_divisors(number):
# Initialize the appropriate variables
  divisor = 1
  total = 0

  # Avoid dividing by 0 and negative numbers 
  # in the while loop by exiting the function
  # if "number" is less than one
  if number < 1:
    return 0 

  # Complete the while loop
  while divisor < number:
    if number % divisor == 0:
      total += divisor
    # Increment the correct variable
    divisor += 1

  # Return the correct variable 
  return total
